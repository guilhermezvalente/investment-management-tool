# Investment Management Tool

  This project aims to create a tool to manage investments, from registering, to tracking results, suggesting allocation, and even calculating income taxes.

  It is my first development project, and my goal is to share the process publically to register my development and, if possible, get insight on improvements.

## Product Vision

  This should be an app, with multiple functionalities, that will serve as your investment management one-stop-shop, what will involve handling both front and back-end, with input functionalities, data storage and data analysis. I'll leverage this project to develop proficiency in Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and solutions architecture.

## Development Process

  Since my biggest goal is to leverage this project for self development, I will start developing individual functionalities independently, and later work towards creating the architecture and, potentially, adjust each code as necessary. This will help me maintain interest as I begin this journey, and see my own development through this process.

### First Functionality: Investment Operations and Upside Report

  This first functionality involves creating a report to (1) describe sales operations, calculating profits, (2) calculate average price and upside of each asset, and (3) summarize all operations, specially notating each asset's average price at each operation.

  Although it would have made more sense to start with the input bit, I decided to start by this one since this was exactly what triggered my interest in this project, because I needed to generate those 3 reports at the end of the year to attach to my income tax report.
